# caitlyns-tile
An example no-op tile contained in one metadata file to get more familiar with Tile structure. This is in opposition to how [kiln](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/kiln) works by separating out the different requirements of a Tile and "baking" it back into one (useful for very large tiles)
